shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite\",\"perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions\",\"daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who are n't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war\",\"although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do\",\"even when foreign directors borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting\",\"for all its failed connections , divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood is nurturing , in a gauzy , dithering way\",\"wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert 's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn\",\"if no one singles out any of these performances as

already seen this kind of thing\",\"going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film\",\"nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it\",\"the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low\",\"so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft core imagery with naughty fun\",\"you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus\",\"if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna\",\"opens as promising as any war adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory a soldier 's story ''\",\"what happened with pluto nash ?\",\"it 's laughing at us\",\"their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i 'd hoped the movie would avoid\",\"well , it does go on forever\",\"de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork\",\"while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling\",\"jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips\",\"if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public\",\"and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy\",\"an ultra low budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent\",\"cho 's fans are sure to be entertained it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that on the basis of this film alone i 'm not one of them\",\"julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan\",\"places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult to swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable
