video game graphics and disney fied adolescent angst","for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry","the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats","the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction","the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity kappa rho alpha phi","it 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish","home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do","she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs","technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial","the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have

and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring","good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops '' was obviously made for the `` xxx '' crowd , people who enjoy

chilled delivery","an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk and slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living","but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship","while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming of age films it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story","like its two predecessors , 1983 's koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel gazing film ever","nothing plot wise is worth e mailing home about","first good , then bothersome","watching trouble every day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms","with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path","not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79 minute after school `` cartoon ''","there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought","the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire breathing monsters barbecue with their breath","proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report","nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex soaked riff on the cannibal genre","some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations","the story is naturally poignant , but first time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business","nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it","ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled nobody deserves any prizes here","well , it does go on forever","opens as promising as any war adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory a soldier 's story ''","going to the website may be just as fun lrb and scary rrb as going to the film","it 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold","the saturation bombing of reggio 's images and glass ' evocative music ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning","the movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens","the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake down the throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball","this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on","this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic

inner struggles of our adolescent heroes insecure , uncontrolled , and intense","a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material","i wonder why","most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness","a sudsy cautionary tale","the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers","it 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff","overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek 's novel by some way","the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year","the movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived in glow","sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece","painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year 's most accomplished and riveting film performances","but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds","the ending is a cop out","has a shambling charm a cheerfully inconsequential diversion","a comprehensive and provocative film one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience","a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film","there 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong","fuller would surely

mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget","a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience","an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller","but even a hero can stumble sometimes","a waste of good performances","without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie","a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy","the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day","just how extreme are these ops ?","this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard hearted cynics","a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable","majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness raiser , if a bit draggy at times","a slick , well oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered","too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century","jir hubac 's script is a gem","the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made

dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video","thoughtful , provocative and entertaining","what happened with pluto nash ?","highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager","an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale","de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest","fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox 's work","no reason for anyone to invest their hard earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either","complex , affecting and uniquely almod var , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers

admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind","this is junk food cinema at its greasiest","clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie","a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience","opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between","thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings","but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship","a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african american 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle","you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling","it 's a terrific american sports movie and dennis

to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul killing as its title is nearly meaningless","at times , however , dogtown and z boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about","ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer thin on dramatic substance","a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass","a wildly funny prison caper","unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me","often hilarious , well shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed","you 've seen them a million times","aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol 's brilliant anti hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it","a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art when done right can help heal , clarify , and comfort","as a randy film about sexy

resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement","somewhat blurred , but kinnear 's performance is razor sharp","disturbing and brilliant documentary","chaotic , self indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature length horror","windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop","the central story lacks punch","a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills","lrb it 's rrb a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy","hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors","marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie","but that 's just the

a lot of fun with the material","girls gone wild and gone civil again","the movie 's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries","enormously likable , partly

heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series","dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick","the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that 's rare in film today , but be warned it 's a slow slog to get there","sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary","too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience","asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy","somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional","if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta","the movie is n't always easy to look at","while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut","ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis","cuts right through the b s giving a big middle fingered `` shut up '' to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another","we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again","the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on","it 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie","ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers","heavy handed exercise in time vaulting literary pretension","sheridan smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth","the movie sticks much closer to hornby 's drop dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did","take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo 's cool jackets","a mild , reluctant , thumbs down","tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films young is cool , and too young is too cool","how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us","hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world","two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more 's the pity","too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing","just one problem fish out of water usually die","it 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original","a morality tale whose thought provoking potential is hampered by a made for tv look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense","a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes","lrb hawn 's character rrb is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten","haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you 're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed","the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students","the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge","director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` the longest yard '' playbook like a checklist","i have n't seen one in so long , no wonder i did n't recognize it at first","this 72 minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow","the gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook","just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail","in the end , ted bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac there 's no larger point , and little social context","just like the deli sandwich lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after lrb or during rrb consumption of its second half","morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start","all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto","it 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition","morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit but it does n't signify a whole lot either","effective but too tepid biopic","the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal","the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr desplechin is content to state it","this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story","lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar","it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb","elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one","wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together","had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin","scotland , pa blurs the line between black comedy and black hole","the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice over instead of speaking to each other","besides , real movie producers are n't this nice","drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality","human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control","several degrees shy of the gross out contests one expects from current teen fare","this horror comedy does n't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap looking monsters unless you count elvira 's hooters","for all of the contemporary post colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear","there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant","parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half hearted messing about just makes us miss wilde 's still contemporary play","the worst kind of independent the one where actors play dress down hicks and

plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense de palma creates","not always too whimsical for its own good lrb but enough to do

narcotizing bland lrb sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie rrb machinations of the biennial disney boy movie","what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche drenched melodrama by mid film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy","thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality takes a tongue in cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda","despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another","while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production","however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release","this ill fitting tuxedo is strictly off the rack","too simple for its own good","anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through","even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate","long after you leave justine , you 'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best whatever that might mean","there 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version","this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob 's excellent adventure seem understated","feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network","the kind of nervous

challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration","for the first time in several years , mr allen has surpassed himself with the magic he 's spun with the hollywood empress of ms leoni 's ellie","if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right","while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , `` in the bedroom , '' moretti 's film makes its own , quieter observations","escapism in its purest form","despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy","it 's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead end experimentation of the director 's previous full frontal","a fairly by the books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy","and in this regard , on guard delivers","you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting","as green guts monster movies go , it 's a beaut","elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone","for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser praised movies","it 's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its `` men in a sardine can '' warped logic","time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets","makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran 's borderlands","this is n't a narrative film i do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i 'm sure some will try but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come","though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work","what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender","he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works","the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology","not a bad journey at all","a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self contained universe","it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes","it suggests the wide ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks","but fans should have fun meeting a brand new pokemon called celebi","4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink it 's the ultimate redneck road trip","the production values are up there","a teasing drama whose relentless good deed bad deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross shaped creation","kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed","tim story 's not there yet but ` barbershop ' shows he 's on his way","those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they do n't really want to know","despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! ''","but some unexpected zigs and zags help","it is not a mass market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another","there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them","an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad","the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40 minute running time","and if the hours wins ` best picture ' i just might","behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies lrb plus one sheep dog rrb , the picture hosts a parka wrapped dose of heart","he 's super spy !","message movie or an action packed submarine spectacular ?","a movie for 11 year old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil ' bow wow","a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy","the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task","it helps that lil bow wow tones down his pint sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid","a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution","gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife","it 's the kind of pigeonhole resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides","there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting","here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get","who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images do n't have to add up to mesmerize you","must be seen to be believed","it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene","as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance","i like frank the pug , though","perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions","windtalkers blows this way and that , but there 's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself","`` antwone fisher '' is an earnest , by the numbers effort by washington","succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long dreaded completion of the police academy
